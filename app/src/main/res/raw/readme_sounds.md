# Placeholder for custom alarm sound
# This file serves as a placeholder for alarm_sound.wav or alarm_sound.mp3
# In a real implementation, you would place actual audio files here such as:
# - alarm_sound.wav
# - emergency_alarm.mp3
# - backup_alarm.ogg

# The EnhancedAudioManager will fall back to system sounds if custom sounds are not available
